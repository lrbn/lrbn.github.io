        <h2>Yes Nails</h2>
        <p>Yes Nails is a local nail salon. I originally created an iOS app (iPad/iPhone) that helps them manage
          customers. The iPad version would be responsible for taking in customers name and their desired services. The
          iPhone version would be used by the staff to see the list of customers and their desired services. I decided
          to port the iOS app into a web app for easier maintanence. I took the advantage of the features of a
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/"><strong><u>Progressive Web App (PWA)</u></strong></a>.
          The web app is hosted on Heroku and uses Firebase Realtime Database to handle customer management. Source code can be available upon request.

        <h2>BMDConnect</h2>
        <p>This was my first hackathon project. I was responsible for the front-end for this web application. The goal
          was to make a web app that solves the following challenge: "How can the city (Indianapolis) promote more
          donations
          of time and resources?" I worked alongside with three people who had done the backend of the app. There is no
          demo available.

        <h2>Pinkman 2</h2>
        <p>This is my first project that I have worked on. This game was developed in the Unity3D game engine. Gameplay
          was programmed in the C# programming language.</p>
