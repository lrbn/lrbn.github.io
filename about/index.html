     <p>I am an undergraduate at 
      <a href="https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/web-programming-and-design"><strong>Purdue University</strong>&nearr;</a> in West Lafayette, Indiana. I am currently studying 
      <a href="https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/web-programming-and-design"><strong>Web Programming & Design</strong>&nearr;</a>. I want to create something that will enrich the lives of the community.
      <br><br>
      I have worked on personal projects that involved programming languages such as C, C++, ARM Assembly, Racket, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, Swift, and JavaScript. I am also familiar with useful programming tools such as vim and git/GitHub. The operating systems that I use the most is Windows and Mac, but I have used Ubuntu before.
